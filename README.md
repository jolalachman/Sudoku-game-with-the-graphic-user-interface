# Sudoku-game-with-the-graphic-user-interface
Object oriented program in C++  which allows a user to play a game of sudoku, later checks the board for any mistakes and rewards one with points that are later stored in a file. The project uses some newly added features of C++ for example ranges and filesystem library.
